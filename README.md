# PowerBI_Practical_Exam_-Daki-

**Description**
Built a Power BI dashboard using simulated sales dataset to analyze revenue, profit, and customer trends. I cleaned the data, modeled relationships, created advanced DAX measures, and designed interactive visuals

Data Cleaning and Transformation
 
The data had some missing values fot the categorical values I replaced the missing values with unknown while for the numerical values are drilled up and down to replace the missing values
Transformations were performed in Power Query â€” including merging tables sales and product to calculate profit, splitting customer names, filtering records post-2018, adding a colums sales category and finding ooutliers in the data which they were none.
